# hello-world
This is your typical repository.

I am a software intern, currently working for Benningfield Group. Primarily, I am the software QA tester and as noted in my Slack profile "I am become bug destroyer of apps." I enjoy learning more and more each day about software testing tools, strategies, concepts, ideas, frameworks, etc, but I also am making progress towards being on the development team. To achieve this, I've started work on FreeCodeCamp's **Front End Development** certificate, and I learn as many concepts, techniques, tools, tips, and technologies I can each day when I am not working on the certificate.

I have moved to Ubuntu 16.04LTS on both my work and home computers. This allows me to have a very clean, fast, and flawless environment for developing.
